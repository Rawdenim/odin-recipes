        <li>1 jar of jelly</li>

        <li>Pick up your bag of white bread and then proceed to open the top of the cover. Then pull out 2 slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Place your slices of bread on a cutting board or plate. Grab your jar of peanut butter and then twist of the cap. Grab a butter knife with the other hand and then remove as much peanut butter to taste. Transfer the peanut butter from the knife to a side of bread.</li>
        <li>Grab a jar of jelly with one hand and then remove the cap with your other hand. Once the cap is removed, place the cap down, grab a butter knife with your free hand, and grab jelly from the tip of your knife.
